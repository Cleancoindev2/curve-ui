            <h2>Curve FAQ</h2>
            <h3>What is Curve?</h3>

            <p>Curve is an exchange liquidity pool on Ethereum (like <a
             href="https://uniswap.exchange/">Uniswap</a>)
            designed for (1) extremely efficient stablecoin trading (2) low
            risk, supplemental fee income for liquidity providers, without an
            opportunity cost.</p>

            <p>Curve allows users (and smart contracts like <a href="https://1inch.exchange/">1inch</a> or
            <a href="https://paraswap.io/">Paraswap</a>) to trade
            between DAI, USDC, USDT, and TUSD with a bespoke low slippage, low fee algorithm
            designed specifically for stablecoins. Behind the scenes, the
            liquidity pool is supplied to the <a href="https://iearn.finance/">iearn</a> protocol, where it
            generates income for liquidity providers.</p>

            <h3>Has Curve been audited?</h3>
            <p>Curve is currently in alpha - the codebase can be found
            <a href="https://github.com/curvefi/curve-contract/tree/iearn_ytokens">on GitHub</a>.
            Please donâ€™t supply your life savings, or assets you
            canâ€™t afford to lose, to Curve, especially as a liquidity
            provider.</p>

            <p>Using Curve as an exchange user should be significantly less
            risky, but this is not advice.</p>

            <h3>How do I trade on Curve?</h3>
            <p>Before trading, youâ€™ll have to approve Curve to interact with
            your DAI, USDC, USDT, and TUSD balance, similar to most DeFi applications.</p>

            <p>On the <a href="/">exchange</a>, select the asset you would like to convert (e.g.
            USDC), and the quantity (e.g. 1,000) - the exchange rate, and
            quantity that you will receive (including and all slippage and fees)
            will be displayed. The exchange rate might surprise you - thatâ€™s the
            power of Curve.</p>

            <h3>How do I provide liquidity to Curve?</h3>

            <p>Curve uses <a href="https://iearn.finance">yTokens</a>,
            assets inside the iearn protocol, as the
            liquidity pool - this ensures that assets are always being put to
            work. You can acquire yDAI or yUSDC by supplying DAI or USDC to
            <a href="https://iearn.finance/">iearn</a>, or by
            acquiring yTokens on <a href="https://1inch.exchange/">1inch</a>
            or <a href="https://paraswap.io/">Paraswap</a>.</p>

            <p>Before providing liquidity, youâ€™ll have to approve Curve to
            interact with your yDAI, yUSDC, yUSDT, or yTUSD balances.</p>

            <p>Visit the <a href="/deposit.html">Curve deposit page</a>, and your available balances should
            appear. If you <b>add all coins in a balanced proportion</b>, you will
            provide cTokens at the current exchange Curve rate; this requires
            you to have both assets in your wallet. You can uncheck this feature
            to supply one side of the market, or a different ratio of assets,
            and Curve will automatically exchange them into the proper quantity
            (with the same low slippage & fees of the Curve exchange) -
            magic!</p>

            <h3>What's "Use maximum amount of coins available"?</h3>
            <p>This means using all USDC, DAI, USDT, and TUSD in your wallet. This way is
            recommended only if you have much less coins than currently in
            liquidity pool.</p>

            <h3>How to withdraw liquidity I provided?</h3>
            <p>Go to <a href="/withdraw.html">the withdraw page</a>. If you want
            to withdraw some percentage of your liquidity (the preferred way),
            type that percentage in the top field.
            You can, however, withdraw in a form of individual coins (USDC,
            DAI, USDT, TUSD), having the exchange happening for you, if you type amounts in
            lower fields. You'll get charge with the exchange fee in the latter
            case.</p>
